# LazyVidEditor
A quick little node app that creates streams from three separate systems to create a comprehensive log of live events. Those three Systems: OBS Websockets, Q-SYS telnet and finally an Extron Telnet. Hoping to eventually log from a Sony Visca serial link as well.

Has a Python Video editor, based on moviepy, and a Powerhell Log Parser!
One day I might attually know a programming language, for now I'll just fumble through these three.
